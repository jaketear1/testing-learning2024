Me testing and learning things! Like: 

* general git workflow
* bci.ipynb -- LabStreamingLayer online signal visualization
* simulations_test.ipynb -- Simulated oscillations and irreversibility and autocorrelations
* umap_test.ipynb -- Parameterizing EEG with FoooF (specparam) to categorize brain state in reduced dimensional space with UMAP, clusterizing and identifying state transition dynamics. Trying to do this to compare my own resting state vs. breathwork conditions that I recorded with my 19 channel EEG system.
* EMA-anxiety.ipynb -- Code for an experiment with my EEG system, using Lab Streaming Layer to record EEG and concurrently prompt the user every 15-20 seconds to assess their anxiety. The idea is to get a ton of epochs to correlate aperiodic exponent with self reported anxiety in those epochs.
